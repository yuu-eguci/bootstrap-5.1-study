Bootstrap 5.1 design study
===

ðŸ’„ In this repository, I tried to study Bootstrap 5.1 and making calendar design without any libraries such as FullCalendar.

## Bootstrap v5

- https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/migration/

There are some differences and breaking changes between v4 and v5. For example, `.right-*` is renamed to `.end-*`. It's interesting.
